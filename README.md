# Time Series Prediction Project


For all portions of year 10, I have used the Decision Tree Classifier from the Sklearn package to predict the parameters 9 to 13.


About the dataset used,


The dataset comprises of information about numerous road segments that was gathered by a corporation. The data for each segment was gathered at a regular interval of one year throughout a period of ten years. Every year, data on 13 different road-related characteristics have been gathered for each segment of the road.


I have forecasted the values for parameters 9 to 13 of each section's 10th year using the model outlined above.
